# Context Manager

Manage the Claude Code memory hierarchy and audit the full markdown landscape of a project. Produces well-organised memory files, detects documentation overlap, and reports the total context footprint.

## Four Context Layers

| Layer | Location | Purpose | What this skill does |
|-------|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Memory** | `./CLAUDE.md`, subdirs, `.claude/rules/*.md` | Project context, commands, architecture, rules | Audit, score, maintain |
| **Project docs** | `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`, `API_ENDPOINTS.md`, `docs/**/*.md` | Technical documentation | Check existence per project type, flag staleness, detect CLAUDE.md overlap |
| **Session** | `SESSION.md`, `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` | Temporary progress tracking | Report presence + size (managed by dev-session) |
| **Public** | `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, other root `.md` | Public-facing docs | Detect CLAUDE.md duplication |

Auto-memory (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md`) is also scanned for awareness but managed by Claude automatically.

## Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Session Capture

**When**: End of session, "capture learnings", "update CLAUDE.md with what we learned"

1. Review the conversation for discoveries worth preserving:
   - Commands that worked (or didn't)
   - Gotchas and workarounds found
   - Architecture decisions made
   - Configuration quirks discovered
   - Patterns that would help future sessions
2. Categorise each discovery using the placement decision tree below
3. Draft all changes as diffs in a single batch
4. Present the batch — apply after a single yes/no confirmation

**Keep it concise**: one line per concept. No verbose explanations, no generic advice.

### Mode 2: Full Audit

**When**: "audit context", "audit memory", "check project docs", periodic maintenance, working in a neglected project

1. Run the audit script:
   ```bash
   python3 skills/context-manager/scripts/audit_memory.py [repo-path]
   ```
2. Review the output:
   - **Memory layer**: CLAUDE.md sizes, quality scores, rules file sizes
   - **Project docs**: existence, staleness, overlap with CLAUDE.md
   - **Session/public**: presence and size
   - **Markdown footprint**: total KB by layer
   - **Overlap warnings**: sections duplicated between files
3. Generate changes autonomously — create, update, or flag files as needed
4. Present all changes as a single batch for approval
5. Apply approved changes

For large repos, delegate to a sub-agent:
```
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  prompt: "Run python3 skills/context-manager/scripts/audit_memory.py /path/to/repo
           and summarise the findings.")
```

### Mode 3: Restructure

**When**: "restructure memory", root CLAUDE.md over 200 lines, first-time memory setup

1. Run full audit (Mode 2) first
2. Split oversized files:
   - Extract topic sections from root CLAUDE.md into `.claude/rules/<topic>.md`
   - Extract directory-specific content into sub-directory CLAUDE.md files
   - Move detailed technical content from CLAUDE.md to `docs/` or `ARCHITECTURE.md` if it's reference material, not operational context
3. Resolve overlaps: if CLAUDE.md duplicates ARCHITECTURE.md or docs/, remove the duplication
4. Create missing documentation files based on project type
5. Present the restructure plan, apply after approval

## Placement Decision Tree

```
Would this still apply if I switched to a completely different project?
├── YES → ~/.claude/rules/<topic>.md
│         (correction rules, API patterns, coding standards)
└── NO  → Is it specific to a subdirectory?
    ├── YES → <dir>/CLAUDE.md
    │         (integrations, directory-specific gotchas)
    └── NO  → Is it reference documentation or operational context?
        ├── Reference → ARCHITECTURE.md or docs/
        │               (system design, schemas, detailed flows)
        └── Operational → ./CLAUDE.md (project root)
                          (identity, stack, commands, critical rules)
```

## Size Targets

| File Type | Target | Maximum |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Root CLAUDE.md | 50-150 lines | 200 |
| Sub-directory CLAUDE.md | 15-50 lines | 80 |
| Rules topic file | 20-80 lines | 120 |

## What Belongs Where

### Root CLAUDE.md
- Project name, purpose, owner
- Tech stack summary
- Build/deploy/test commands (copy-paste ready)
- Directory structure overview
- Critical "never do X" rules
- Key integrations and secrets locations

### Sub-directory CLAUDE.md
- External service integrations for that component
- Non-obvious configuration specific to this area
- Directory-specific commands
- Gotchas when working in this directory

**Don't create when**: parent covers it, directory is self-explanatory, content would be under 10 lines.

### .claude/rules/ topic files
- Correction rules bridging training cutoff (e.g. API changes, deprecated patterns)
- Coding patterns and standards
- Platform-specific formatting rules
- Error prevention patterns

### docs/ and ARCHITECTURE.md
- Detailed system architecture (component diagrams, data flows)
- Database schemas and migration guides
- API endpoint catalogues
- Content that Claude should read on demand, not every session

**Rule of thumb**: If it's needed every session, put it in CLAUDE.md. If it's reference material consulted occasionally, put it in docs/.

### What to delete
- Content Claude already knows from training
- Verbose explanations of standard frameworks
- Changelogs or version history (use git)
- Duplicated content (between CLAUDE.md and docs/, ARCHITECTURE.md, or README.md)
- "TODO" items that were never completed
- Generic advice not specific to the project

## Project Type Detection

The audit script detects project type from file presence and suggests appropriate documentation:

| Indicator | Type | Suggested Docs |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| `wrangler.jsonc` / `wrangler.toml` | Cloudflare Worker | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| `vite.config.*` + `.tsx` files | Vite/React | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| `next.config.*` | Next.js | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| MCP patterns in `src/index.ts` | MCP Server | ARCHITECTURE.md, API_ENDPOINTS.md |
| `src/routes/` or `src/api/` | API Project | API_ENDPOINTS.md, DATABASE_SCHEMA.md |
| Drizzle/Prisma config | Database | DATABASE_SCHEMA.md |

All projects get CLAUDE.md. Additional docs only when the project type warrants them. See [references/project-types.md](references/project-types.md) for full detection heuristics and doc templates.

## Autonomy Rules

- **Just do it**: Run audit, detect project type, identify gaps, draft changes
- **Brief confirmation**: Apply changes (single batch yes/no, not item-by-item)
- **Ask first**: Delete existing content, major restructures (moving 50+ lines), create new project docs from scratch where there's ambiguity about content

## Quality Scoring

The audit script scores each CLAUDE.md on 6 criteria (100 points):

| Criterion | Points | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Commands/Workflows | 20 | Build, test, deploy documented |
| Architecture Clarity | 20 | Structure, relationships, entry points |
| Non-Obvious Patterns | 15 | Gotchas, quirks, warnings |
| Conciseness | 15 | Dense content, no filler |
| Currency | 15 | References valid, commands work |
| Actionability | 15 | Copy-paste ready, real paths |

See [references/quality-criteria.md](references/quality-criteria.md) for the full rubric.

## Reference Files

| When | Read |
|------|------|
| Scoring CLAUDE.md quality | [references/quality-criteria.md](references/quality-criteria.md) |
| Detecting project type and expected docs | [references/project-types.md](references/project-types.md) |
| Creating new CLAUDE.md or rules files | [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) |

## Scripts

- `scripts/audit_memory.py` — Scan all four layers, score quality, detect project type, report footprint and overlap
  - `python3 audit_memory.py [repo-path]` — human-readable report
