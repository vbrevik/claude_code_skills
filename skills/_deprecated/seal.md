# 🔒 Seal — Clean Commits, Every Time

> **DEPRECATED in MemStack v3.0** — This skill is now a deterministic CC hook.
> See `.claude/hooks/pre-push.sh` and `.claude/settings.json`.
> This file is preserved as fallback for older CC versions without hook support.
*The guardian that ensures every push is build-verified and properly formatted.*

## Activation

When this skill activates, output:

`🔒 Seal — Clean commits, every time.`

Then execute the protocol below.

## Context Guard

| Context | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **User says "commit" with intent to create a git commit** | ACTIVE — full protocol | P1 |
| **User explicitly says "push" or "ship it"** | DEFER to Deploy — Seal handles commit step only | P2 |
| **User explicitly says "skip build check"** | ACTIVE — skip step 1 only | P1 |
| **Discussing git concepts ("what is a commit", "how does push work")** | DORMANT | — |
| **Reading git logs, blame, or history** | DORMANT | — |
| **User says "deploy" or "build"** | DORMANT — Deploy skill handles this | — |
| **Mid-task coding (user hasn't asked to commit)** | DORMANT — don't interrupt | — |
| **Amending or rebasing (user managing git history)** | DORMANT — don't interfere | — |

### Deconfliction with Deploy
Seal handles **commits**. Deploy handles **pushes and deployments**. When a user says "push", Deploy activates and may invoke Seal's commit protocol as a sub-step. Seal should NOT independently activate on "push" — it waits for Deploy to call it.

## Protocol

1. **Run build check:**
   ```bash
   npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20
   ```
   If build fails — STOP. Fix errors before proceeding.

2. **Check git status:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --stat
   ```

3. **Stage only relevant files.** Never `git add .` blindly. Exclude:
   - `node_modules/`, `.env`, `.env.local`, any secrets
   - Build output (`dist/`, `.next/`, `out/`)
   - OS files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

4. **Generate commit message** using config.json format:
   - Default: `[ProjectName] Brief description of change`
   - Be specific — describe WHAT changed and WHY
   - Add `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

5. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add <specific files>
   git commit -m "[Project] Message

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   git push
   ```

6. **Verify push succeeded** — run `git status` after push.

## Mandatory Rules
- NEVER commit with `--no-verify`
- NEVER force push to main/master
- NEVER amend published commits without explicit user request
- Always create NEW commits after hook failures

## Example Usage

**User:** "commit this"

```
🔒 Seal — Clean commits, every time.

Build check:  ✓ passed
Staging:      3 files (page.tsx, route.ts, migration.sql)
Commit:       [AdminStack] Add CC Monitor page for session tracking
Push:         main → origin/main ✓
```

## Level History

- **Lv.1** — Base: Build check, staged commits, descriptive messages. (Origin: MemStack v1.0, Feb 2026)
- **Lv.2** — Enhanced: Added YAML frontmatter, context guard, mandatory rules, activation message. (Origin: MemStack v2.0 MemoryCore merge, Feb 2026)
- **Lv.3** — DEPRECATED: Replaced by deterministic CC hook `.claude/hooks/pre-push.sh`. Skill preserved as fallback. (Origin: MemStack v3.0, Feb 2026)
